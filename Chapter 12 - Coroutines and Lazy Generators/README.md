# C++ High Performance (2nd Edition)

## Highlights from Chapter 12 - "Coroutines and Lazy Generators"

### Coroutine Example
A quick example of how `std::iota` can be represented with a generator and some co-routine techniques.

Kudos to the author for including a header file that checks for `<experimental/coroutine>` as well as `<coroutine>` - this was a nice touch, and necessary in order to run the code on Xcode.
