# C++ High Performance (2nd Edition)

## Highlights from Chapter 12 - "Coroutines and Lazy Generators"

### Coroutine Example
A quick example of how `std::iota` can be represented with a generator and some co-routine techniques.

Kudos to the author for including a header file that checks for `<experimental/coroutine>` as well as `<coroutine>` - this was a nice touch, and necessary in order to run the code on Xcode.

### Coroutines vs Subroutines
> _"coroutines are subroutines that also can be suspended and resumed. Another way to look at it is to say that subroutines are a specialization of coroutines that cannot be suspended or resumed."_ â€“ pg. 390
#
### CPU Registers
A nice attempt at teaching pseudo-Assembly, although I wish they'd just used Assembly instead of moxing up the commands and "source / destination" ordering from Intel and AT&T syntaxes:
```diff
- add     73, R1
+ addl    $73, %eax (AT&T)
+ add     eax, 73   (Intel)

- mov     SP,  R2
+ movl    -8(%rbp), %eax            (AT&T)
+ mov     eax, dword ptr [rbp - 8]  (Intel)

- mov     R2, [R1]
+ movl    %eax, -8(%rbp)             (AT&T)
+ mov     dword ptr [rbp - 8], eax   (Intel)
```
#
### Call frames
When a function is being called, a __*call frame*__ for that function is created, containing the following:
- parameters
- local variables
- a snapshot of the registers
- a return address that links back to the place in memory where the call was invoked
- an optional frame pointer

A call frame stored on the stack is called a __*stack frame*__.
#
### Stackful vs Stackless
> _"Stackful coroutines have a separate side stack (similar to a thread) that contains the coroutine frame and the nested call frames. This makes it possible to suspend from nested call frames:"_ â€“ pg. 396

> _"the coroutine itself needs to create the coroutine frame and copy the parameters and registers from the call frame to the coroutine frame when it is called:"_ â€“ pg. 396

> _"stackless coroutines use the stack of the currently running thread to handle nested function calls. The effect of this is that a stackless coroutine can never suspend from a nested call frame."_ â€“ pg. 398

#
### Stackful Coroutines vs Threasds
Each have their own stack - hwoever,...:
* Switching threads is a kernel operation, and kernel operations are expensive (pg. 393)
* Most OS's switch threads premptively, as opposed to cooperatively like in coroutines.

#
### Performance
Stackful coroutines are dynamically-allocated, and can either be segmented or expanding (like how `std::vector` grows).

Stackless coroutines do not allocate memory dynamically

The memory footprint im summary:
* __*Stackless*__ â€“ Coroutine frame
* __*Stackful*__ - Coroutine frame + call stack

#
### Context switching
It's generally more expensive to switch between stackful coroutines than it is stackless.
> _"...a stackful coroutine has a more expensive context switch operation since it has more information to save and restore during suspend and resume compared to a stackless coroutine. Resuming a stackless coroutine is comparable to a normal function call."_ â€“ pg. 401

#
### Coroutines in C++
Coroutines in C++ are stackless.

They offer very little memory overhead, efficient context switching, high flexibility (more than 15 customisation points), and don't require C++ exceptions to handle errors (this makes them potentially very useful for the likes of embedded systems or real-time / low-latency environments).

#
### Keywords
* `co_await` - suspend the current coroutine
* `co_yield` - spit out a value and suspend the coroutine
* `co_return` - complete the coroutine (can also return value)

* `std::coroutine_handle` - template class that refers to the coroutine's state (allows for suspending and resuming)
* `std::suspend_never` - trivial awaitable type that never suspens
* `std::suspend_always` - trival awaitable type that always suspends
* `std::coroutine_traits` - defines promise type

#
### Restrictions
* Can't use variadic arguments
* Can't use `auto` (thank goodness..)
* Can't be `constexpr` (maybe less good)
* Constructors / destructors can't be coroutines (and neither can `main()`)

We cannot access the coroutine state by any other means than through the handle (the coroutine state also contains the __*promise*__).

Values or errors from the coroutine passed to the promise â€“ it acts like a conduit between the coroutine and the handler, but (oddly) neither have direct access.

#
## Our first coroutine example
A bit convoluted in how the code was presented in the book, but a good example of what boilerplate is needed to make the coroutine work, as well as what a coroutine actually is!

Basically, it's like having more than one `main()` function.

In real-world terms, it's like "put the kettle on, grind your coffee beans, put your grinds in the french press, go back to the kettle for the boiled water, then go back to the french press to start pouring your water" - the coroutines allow us to keep track of both progress and state  i.e. the grinds don't turn back into beans when we pick up the kettle and wonder why the water unboiled the moment we stopped looking at it ðŸ˜…

Powerful stuff.
